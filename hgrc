# ediff has not the most friendly shell interface.  The best way to
# terminate the merge with this setup is 'wcC-xC-c'.  If you use
# ediff's quit command it will ask a bunch of stupid questions and not
# actually quit Emacs.  There's also no good way to abort a merge and
# exit with a non-zero status, so we set checkchanged to true.  This
# thread has an excellent analysis of why this is broken and what
# should be done about it:
