Note well:

*******************************THIS CURSORS ARE NOT MY WORK***************************************

I've only ported and changed them a bit to fit better in XFree86(TM)

The real author of this cursors is Maur
check his website mWorks Studio in http://maur.shellscape.net/ 

There you'll find the original Reversion Redux aka RevRedux cursors and other great cursors (see carbon6 and Nuit, these are great!)

The tiny icons on copy, move and link cursors are from crystal xcursors (http://www.kdelook.org/content/show.php?content=6240)
Also the index.theme and the install script are from based in justblue cursors(http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=10163)

A big thanks to those artists!
