! This changes the left control key into a super key on mod3 to emulate
! the flag key, since Thinkpads have no flag key.  The proper control
! key is mapped by the X keyboard rules, so it is not necessary to do
! that here.

! Change the left control key into a super key
keycode 37 = Super_L

! Wipe the modifier maps that interact with control and super
clear Control
clear Mod3
clear Mod4

! And rewrite those modifier maps
add Control = Control_L Control_R
add Mod3 = Super_L
